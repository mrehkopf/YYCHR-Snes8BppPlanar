# YYCHR-Snes8BppPlanar
Plugin for YYCHR to handle the SNES 8bpp planar format.
YYCHR has two formats for SNES 8bpp built in, but both use the chunky Mode 7 format and are not suitable for regular 256 color bitmaps as used by Modes 3 and 4.

To compile, put CharactorLib.dll from YYCHR in the same directory as Snes8BppPlanar.cs.
